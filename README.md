This website was created as a personal project to showcase my HTML skills. I used HTML to create a user-friendly and mobile-friendly website that provides information about Nestle's products, services, and history.

Features:
HTML: The website was built using HTML, a markup language that is used to create web pages.
CSS: The website was styled using CSS, a style sheet language that is used to control the presentation of web pages.
Responsive design: The website is responsive, meaning that it adapts to the size of the screen it is being viewed on.
Mobile-friendly: The website is mobile-friendly, meaning that it can be easily viewed on mobile devices.
